# AsuMathLabG25
# Intro
Mathlab is a C++ library software similar to MATLAB
# Specifications

● Using C/C++

● Development under linux

● Production to linux server (Centos 6.7)

● Any C/C++ IDE works under linux.

● g++ compiler, makefile is required.

● Source Control, Issue Tracking, Documents at Bitbucket

# Phases
1. Core operations (3 Weeks)
2. Advanced Operations and Tuning (3 Weeks)
3. Advanced system operations (4 Weeks after exams)

# Phase 1: Core Operations
● Implement C++ class for matrix
● Support dynamic creation and destruction of matrices of any size
● Support addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose and division
● Process input user commands and show results directly
● Process input file, show each step result then exit

Acceptance Conditions:
● Delivered at provided server.
● Provide correct result identical to Matlab or Octave.
Competition:
● Fastest response time for large inputs.


# Phase 1: Process
● Study requirements (from Matlab docs)
● Implement the code
● Apply system test
● Upload code to production server
● Cross group testing
● Acceptance test and results


# Phase 1: Core Operations
> A = [1.4 2.2 3.2; 4.4 5.4 6.4; 3.3 4.2 2.2];
> B = [1.5 4.1 5.4; 3.1 4.2 1.2; 3.2 4.3 2.2];
> C = A + B
> D = A - B
> E = A * B
> F = A / B
> G = A’


# Phase 2: Advanced Operations and Tuning
● Support mathematical functions.
○ Trigonometric, Logarithmic, Roots, Power
● Support mathematical expressions.
○ Either with (dot) or not.
● Support flexible matrix parser.
○ Accept matrix in matrix, expressions and variables
● Support error handling.
○ Do not crash for invalid input.

Acceptance Conditions:
● Delivered at provided server.
● Provide correct result identical to Matlab or Octave.
Competition:
● Fastest response time for large inputs.
● How many mathematical operations supported.
